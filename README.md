Internet Computing Assignment 3

1-So Inside the main folder you will find 3 folders namely : 'Part_1', 'Part_2', 'Part_3'.

2-In Part 1, it contains different classes which explains the inheritance, method overriding, method overloading etc concepts. In this just run the 'Hospital.java' file so that you will be able to see the desired output.

3-In Part 2, it has a 'JunitTesting.java' named file. This file has the main logical code to find out divide method. And the test case for divide method has been placed in a test class file like divideTest.java which is Junit file.

4-In Part 3, it has 2 folders. In the Folder 'Validation_xsd', it contains an XML File, an XSD File and a Validator java class file. You can run the Validator java class File so that it validates the XML and XSD documents and displays the output. If the flag becomes true thenm the XML document got validated against the XSD Document. Similarly in the Folder 'Validation_DTD', it contains an XML, DTD and validator file. You can run the Validator java class File so that it validates the XML and DTD documents. The flag comes as true if the XML Document is validated against the DTD Document.

Thank you.
